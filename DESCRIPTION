Description: The Scisor-Wiz package visualizes single-cell RNA long-read 
    sequencing, for example from the scisorseqr package (Joglekar et. al 2021), 
    which processes long reads for differential isoform analysis. Scisor-Wiz 
    allows the user to visualize alternative splicing patterns of any user-
    specified gene present in a dataset for <=6 different user-specified cell 
    types. Reads are displayed by cell type, and clustered according to the 
    intron chain, TSS and/or polyA-site within each cell cluster. Nucleotide
    mismatches can also be plotted using the MismatchFinder function to display
    Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), nucleotide insertions, and nucleotide 
    deletions.
