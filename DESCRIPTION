Title: Visualizes isoforms of a gene across multiple cell types
Version: 1.1.3.7

Description: The ScisorWiz package visualizes single-cell RNA long-read 
    sequencing, for example from the scisorseqr package (Joglekar et. al 2021), 
    which processes long reads for differential isoform analysis. ScisorWiz 
    allows the user to visualize alternative splicing patterns of any user-
    specified gene present in a dataset for any number of user-specified cell 
    types. Reads are displayed by cell type, and clustered according to the 
    intron chain, TSS and/or polyA-site within each cell cluster. Nucleotide
    mismatches can also be plotted using the MismatchFinder function to display
    Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), nucleotide insertions, and nucleotide 
    deletions.
